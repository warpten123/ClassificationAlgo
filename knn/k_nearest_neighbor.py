student face face counterpart in addition student retention issue postsecondary institution data previous study lower retention rate online student traditional face face classmate the current study contradicted 57 argument in section implication action recommendation research concluding remark addressed implication action a postsecondary institution 21st century examined issue student recruitment retention effort meet demand student community the majority postsecondary institution initiated online education strategy recruit student traditional geographic area this study supported existing research utilizing grade measure achievement alleviate doubt online student shortchanged education the transition existing face face course online delivery model accomplished sacrificing achievement program goal the study also examined program retention data finding significant difference online traditional student ta program the finding study support expansion additional online course program school applied study finally study provide basis action including analyzing program course offered online format university the analysis program offered online delivery model enhance development online course program recommendation future research distance education delivery expanded dramatically use internet online instruction the present study continued future year measure effect specific curriculum delivery model online 58 delivery platform in addition study expanded include specific characteristic student retention named literature examining age entering gpa student insight program retention the study also expanded include university similar baccalaureate degree completion program discipline because body research limited baccalaureate degree completion student begin postsecondary education career oriented instruction continuing study baccalaureate completion rate online format traditionally based setting concluding remark the current study examined technology administration program offered online face face format utilizing data fall 2002 spring 2008 the ta program developed student completed occupationally oriented aa degree complete bachelor
