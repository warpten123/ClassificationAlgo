Stressful occupations military police firefighters doctors nurses social workers airline pilots frontline public safety security health wellbeing Their jobs physically mentally demanding highly stressful well affect endocrine system In long term factors affect health performance ultimately impacting job effectiveness quality life Insufficient aerobic physical activity recommended minimum 150 moderate min week obesity recognized factors interact physical demands mental health stress variety occupations especially recognized highly stressful In addition insufficient strength training low skeletal muscle mass lower movement potential increase risk sarcopenia reducing ability perform quality life They compounding negative effects occupational performance health working population occupations On hand sufficient physical activity healthy body composition low body fat percentage sufficient muscle mass mitigate negative effects Moreover physical activity exercise improve endocrine responses pre condition sustainable health outcomes To end special collection focuses mechanisms endocrine system effects physical activity behaviors obesity stress health performance stressful occupations We aim frontline research around world provide answers inform clinical practice field specialists agency leaders policy makers future research endeavors Our goal attract research insights mechanisms occupational behavioral influence endocrine system health people performing physically demanding stressful jobs An additional goal provide guidelines tools facilitating healthy human
