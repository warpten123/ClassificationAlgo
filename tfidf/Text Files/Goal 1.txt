Internet replaced correspondence television video courses method choice delivery Russell 1999 Utilizing grades measure achievement meta analyses conducted Russell 1999 Shachar Neumann 2003 Machtmes Asher 2002 significant difference grades online students traditional classroom based 55 students These analyses utilized multiple studies information comparing grades online students traditional face

United States Department Education The results present study significant difference retention rates These results supported findings Carmel Gold 2007 reported significant difference retention rates online students compared traditional face face students analysis students multiple 56 courses disciplines 4 year university The present study expanded results examining data discipline 6 year period controlling delivery two separate instructors Research program completion rates AAS students conducted primarily traditional university settings including Townsend 2002 studies University Missouri Columbia Townsend results showed lower baccalaureate completion rate students entering AAS students transferred 4 year universities AA degree Studies Hogan 1997 vocational education programs also lower program completion rate online students compared students traditional delivery vocational education programs Analysis data current study showed significant difference program completion rate students began online TA courses compared students began program face face courses Conclusions The use distance education postsecondary instruction primarily form Internet changed challenged views traditional university based instruction Multiple studies designed effort examine online students level academic achievement traditional higher education peers The present study agrees research indicating statistically significant difference grades online students face face counterparts In addition student retention issue postsecondary institutions data previous studies lower retention rate online students traditional face face classmates The current study contradicted 57 arguments In sections implications action recommendations research concluding remarks addressed Implications Action As postsecondary institutions 21st century examined issues student recruitment retention effort meet demands students communities The majority postsecondary institutions initiated online education strategy recruit students traditional geographic areas This study supported existing research utilizing grades measure achievement alleviate doubt online students shortchanged education The transition existing face face courses online delivery model accomplished sacrificing achievement program goals The study also examined program retention data finding significant differences online traditional students TA program The findings study support expansion additional online courses programs School Applied Studies Finally study provide basis action including analyzing programs courses offered online format University The analysis programs offered online delivery model enhance development online courses programs Recommendations Future Research Distance education delivery expanded dramatically use Internet online instruction The present study continued future years measure effects specific curriculum delivery models online 58 delivery platforms In addition study expanded include specific characteristics student retention named literature examining age entering GPA students insight program retention The study also expanded include universities similar baccalaureate degree completion programs disciplines Because body research limited baccalaureate degree completion students begin postsecondary education career oriented instruction continuing study baccalaureate completion rates online format traditionally based settings Concluding Remarks The current study examined Technology Administration program offered online face face format utilizing data Fall 2002 Spring 2008 The TA program developed students completed occupationally oriented AAS degree complete bachelor degree program Three hypotheses tested study examining grades retention program retention students enrolled online face face courses Technology Administration No significant difference hypotheses These results form strong foundation expanding online courses programs Washburn University By addressing two major concerns educators achievement retention study results expansion online courses programs benefit data driven decision making Other institutions utilize data examine existing
