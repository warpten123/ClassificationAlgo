productivity rise enterprise size small enterprises productive large The characteristic small enterprises1 constitute overwhelming proportion private sector establishments employ 45 65 cent workforce They important source employment developing developed countries Thirdly wages lower workers rights conditions adequate job quality lower enterprises Taken characteristics significant portion labour force countries employed small low productivity establishments workers earn lower wages fewer rights workers larger enterprises This depiction small enterprises throws important issues organize around question concern challenge The question inefficient enterprises forced market large productive firms This happen natural process economic competition The survival firms raises important concern poor wages working conditions linked lower productivity adequate support decent living In poor countries also developed countries people working unable poverty This concern raises important challenge interested reducing poverty decent work The challenge ways link productivity improvements decent work virtuous cycle In cycle enhanced productivity lead wages benefits working conditions working conditions achieved effective labour management cooperation social institutions broader process social dialogue support higher productivity The present paper organized around issues The question dealt section The probable answer small large firms continue exist compete directly Very small firms notably informal economy tend forced market competition offer employment economy develops The concern analysed section review evidence wages working conditions reveals job quality lower small enterprises In cases people earning minimum wage We diversity experience enterprise owners poor earn formal sector employees The challenge considered section Here suggest productivity improvements wages working conditions encouraged supported training effective social institutions The main focus SEED job quality activities examples case studies The bias labour productivity comparing small large enterprises Much research productivity based single indicator labour productivity This measure easy calculate practical sense comparison time countries It measure 1 Unless term small paper groups enterprises classified micro small medium The actual size enterprises varies country definitions 1 deficiencies pose grave concerns general cross country comparisons pose problem comparing large small enterprises Productivity relationship output inputs It rises increase output occurs proportionate increase inputs output produced fewer inputs In case ratio output quantity quality inputs increased When data inputs total factor productivity TFP calculated Due inclusiveness complete measure It difficult record inputs sector economy Instead main inputs calculate multi factor productivity The KLEMS measure includes capital K labour energy materials services broader multi factor measures Schreyer Pilat 2001 Labour productivity indicator single factor measure It results calculation added output intermediate component inputs divided amount labour 2 It also called added worker Despite labour productivity increases added rises utilization coordination factors production Value added increase labour working smarter harder faster skills also increases use machinery reduction waste input materials introduction technical innovations Indeed raises added raise labour productivity The term correct change increases added makes workers productive slightly misleading denotes productivity general specifically relating workers Why understanding labour productivity important relate issues poverty A productivity increase greater returns factors production If increase labour productivity arises trained treated efficient workers support higher wages But increase labour productivity arises use additional machinery gains pay machinery This means enterprises high capital investment obliged higher labour productivity pay additional capital Statistics compare labour productivity large firms small firms exhibit lower capital investment systematic bias There another bias empirical research Much work focuses data gathered industrial censuses surveys manufacturing firms Manufacturing much affected economies scale service activities A large proportion small enterprises engaged services notably trading also catering repair work personal services The extent two biases affect data requires research Despite limitation labour productivity measure paper much evidence reviewed based 1 Why small enterprises driven market This section reviews evidence productivity gap small large enterprises It considers existence gap static sense snapshot contrasts important role small enterprises play providing employment The issue employment shifts small large enterprises time also 2 Or correctly number hours worked 2 considered The question title answered suggestion small enterprises survive avoiding direct competition large firms 1 1 Cross regional evidence size productivity gap A positive correlation enterprise size labour productivity evident main regions developing
