enterprise productive large the characteristic small enterprises1 constitute overwhelming proportion private sector establishment employ 45 65 cent workforce they important source employment developing developed country thirdly wage lower worker right condition adequate job quality lower enterprise taken characteristic significant portion labour force country employed small low productivity establishment worker earn lower wage fewer right worker larger enterprise this depiction small enterprise throw important issue organize around question concern challenge the question inefficient enterprise forced market large productive firm this happen natural process economic competition the survival firm raise important concern poor wage working condition linked lower productivity adequate support decent living in poor country also developed country people working unable poverty this concern raise important challenge interested reducing poverty decent work the challenge way link productivity improvement decent work virtuous cycle in cycle enhanced productivity lead wage benefit working condition working condition achieved effective labour management cooperation social institution broader process social dialogue support higher productivity the present paper organized around issue the question dealt section the probable answer small large firm

value added increase labour working smarter harder faster skill also increase use machinery reduction waste input material introduction technical innovation indeed raise added raise labour productivity the term correct change increase added make worker productive slightly misleading denotes productivity general specifically relating worker why understanding labour productivity important relate issue poverty a productivity increase greater return factor production if increase labour productivity arises trained treated efficient worker support higher wage but increase labour productivity arises use additional machinery gain pay machinery this mean enterprise high capital investment obliged higher labour productivity pay additional capital statistic compare labour productivity large firm small firm exhibit lower capital investment systematic bias there another bias empirical research much work focus data gathered industrial census survey manufacturing firm
