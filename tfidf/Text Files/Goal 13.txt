helpful The authors responsibility material contained views expressed paper Abstract Actuaries aware combined impact climate change limitations resources two separate significant issues putting risk sustainability current socio economic systems support life Although actuaries claim professional expertise environmental issues guided growing body knowledge publicly reliable scientific sources Being qualified deal modelling financial consequences risks uncertainties actuarial profession duty provide training education climate change sustainability members qualified contribute well society In

physical damage resulting extreme weather events sea level rise Mitigating resource scarcity entails adopting approaches circular economy This refers industrial economy restorative definition It aims rely renewable energy favors recycling minimizes tracks eliminates use toxic chemicals eradicates wastes careful design The mitigation strategy guided paradigm defining planetary boundary framework providing science based analysis risk human overuse resources destabilize earth system planetary scale The potential impact actuarial methods assumptions especially future growth expectations pervasive work actuaries affects traditional life life health pensions areas investment practices newer areas enterprise risk management The actuarial profession created groups national international

North American actuarial associations jointly creating actuarial climate risk indexes monitor future provide comparisons benchmarks data published climate scientists Actuaries examine different scenarios climate change use resources quantify risks provide guidance cost benefit analyses Given multidisciplinary nature issues actuaries benefit inputs actuarial entities work cooperation professionals serve public optimizing policy options Part 1 Introduction 1 1 Objective Extensive discussions taking place throughout world forms media subjects global warming climate change These discussions point global dangers posed earth warming Discussions also taking place related question resource limitations manner humans planet limited resources The purpose paper provide education members CIA This consist providing background issues identifying current future risks involved financial impacts posed risks worldwide efforts minimize risks Empowered wider access knowledge actuaries

discussions climate change driven worldwide climate scientists There members CIA good understanding issues involved But majority actuaries understanding As result actuaries guided work done climate science community No doubt even climate change science community differing views nature amplitude risks actuaries aware differing views However fact large majority community view risks posed climate change disastrous consequences action actuaries distinct possibilities The fact climate science evolving opposing views valid reason profession choose As understood work done climate scientists impacts climate change wide ranging extreme climate increased losses floods storms rising sea levels food scarcity clean water shortage increased mortality illness devaluation assets constraints energy use The actuarial community obtain good understanding issues involved Just sitting severely damage profession reputation The issue climate change recognized professions The actuarial community benefit finding perceptions different professions climate change affect work done A classic proactive action actuarial profession handled risk AIDS early 1980s As world aware AIDS risk different actuarial bodies designed variety infection scenarios enabled life insurance industry set adequate reserves additional mortality A similar proactive approach address risks posed climate change The methods solutions different steps risk recognition quantification different scenarios Part 2 Climate Change Process Reasons Future Impacts 2 1 What Climate Change Climate change subject weather

people rights life health food water The risks highest developing countries extreme weather events crop failures emergencies related climate change projected occur greater frequency Most developing countries also lack technological financial resources adapt climate change Indeed facing increased difficulties realizing economic social cultural rights people financial economic food crises growing populations The capacity developing countries realize human rights domestically limited result use developed countries global atmospheric space global carbon budget This paper sets relevance international human rights obligations light multiple constraints climate change poses sustainable development developing countries These legally binding obligations agreed states creation United Nations incorporated widely ratified human rights treaties Legal human rights obligations specifically require states act protect peoples individuals violations human rights states cooperate end Climate change impact wide range human rights potentially lead widespread violation Preventing climate change induced human rights violations requires intensive international cooperation In requires inequities developed developing countries peoples addressed accordance legal principle affirmative action This principle incorporated international human rights law expression exception general principle states sovereign equals means generally states legal obligations It state treat right holders differently treating right holders similarly unequal positions inequalities maintained This paper demonstrates framework provided United Nations Framework Convention Climate Change UNFCCC suitable facilitate rights based cooperation accordance principle affirmative action legal duty states cooperate realize human rights The UNFCCC framework including UNFCCC Kyoto Protocol premised legal principles run parallel reinforce international human rights obligations The framework balances concerns development developing countries responsibilities obligations countries address climate change mitigate human rights harm Of importance principles equity differentiated responsibilities respective capabilities developed developing countries In accordance principles developed countries specific obligations mitigate emissions order modify longer term trends global emissions provide financing technology transfer developing countries adaptation sustainable development An assessment developed countries compliance UNFCCC obligations reveals persistent compliance gap It proven difficult address gap legal mechanisms notably UNFCCC lacks enforcement mechanism In viii inherent legal basis internationally agreed human rights norms deserves special attention As legally binding international norms human rights rules reaffirmed continuously two thirds international community two states also Parties UNFCCC Human rights also lay basis concept erga omnes obligations owed entire world inhabitants As failure developed countries comply UNFCCC obligations result widespread human rights violations developing countries turn international tribunals address failure In words international tribunals requested clarify legal obligations states international human rights law relation climate change climate change legislation This opportunity encouraging timely adequate action climate change viable compliance minimum norms continues economic ecological inequities developed developing countries increase even result I INTRODUCTION It well accepted climate change caused human

greatest contributors climate change Historically developed countries result industrialization process production consumption patterns accounted around fourths total anthropogenic emissions greenhouse gases atmosphere start Industrial Revolution around 1850 present Developing countries larger populations result lower industrialization levels contributed much anthropogenic emissions Currently 15
