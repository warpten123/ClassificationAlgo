4 Abstract Consumers contribute sustainable development choose environmentally friendly fair trade products sustainable products everyday grocery shopping On downside purchasing sustainable groceries requires extra effort sustainable products expensive conventional products What beneficial effects sustainable consumption environmental preservation materialize time result repeated purchases people Because collective efforts needed achieve sustainability individual consumers uncertain purchase decisions make difference This research project addressed question motivate consumers purchase sustainable groceries uncertainties individual drawbacks sustainable consumption There two main objectives investigate individual characteristics distinguish frequent buyers sustainable groceries frequent buyers provide insights consumers encouraged purchase sustainable groceries To ends two studies conducted Study 1 online survey addressed objective More precisely purpose study investigate well social values time perspective efficacy predict purchasing sustainable groceries In domain grocery purchasing individual characteristics studied As efficacy general sustainable development efficacy explored The former refers people perceived general ability deal stressors achieve desired outcomes latter refers degree people feel contribute sustainable development construct studied It assumed pro social values long term time perspective high efficacy characterize consumers frequently purchase sustainable groceries Consumers purchase sustainable groceries frequently contrast assumed

sustainable development encouraging people engage sustainable behaviors In sum perceived ability indirectly contribute sustainable development predicted sustainable consumption perceived ability

time perspective efficacy accounted overlapping parts variance sustainable consumption The relations focal variables generally expected directions Study 2 intervention study addressed objective It investigated consumers encouraged purchase sustainable groceries help informational intervention The main focus intervention provide information individual consumers contribute sustainable development individual contribution sustainable development encourage consumers join The effects intervention sustainable 6 development efficacy sustainable consumption purchasing intentions actual product purchases assessed The participants 145 people living municipality Bergen randomly assigned two groups intervention group control group The results study reported Paper 3 It intervention strengthened intentions purchase domestic seasonal products certified ecological products In addition intervention promoted actual purchasing ecological fair trade products Self efficacy affected intervention Thus increased preferences sustainable groceries intervention group explained efficacy In sum results research project consumers purchase sustainable groceries regular basis tend attach importance welfare long term future consequences actions personally contribute sustainable development Furthermore consumers encouraged purchase sustainable groceries provided information individuals directly indirectly contribute sustainable development These findings inform theorists politicians activists intend contribute promotion sustainable consumption ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 1 Introduction Sustainable development
