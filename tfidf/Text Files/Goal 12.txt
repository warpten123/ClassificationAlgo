sustainable grocery help informational intervention the main focus intervention provide information individual consumer contribute sustainable development individual contribution sustainable development encourage consumer join the effect intervention sustainable 6 development efficacy sustainable consumption purchasing intention actual product purchase assessed the participant 145 people living municipality bergen randomly assigned two group intervention group control group the result study reported paper 3 it intervention strengthened intention purchase domestic seasonal product certified ecological product in addition intervention promoted actual purchasing ecological fair trade product self efficacy affected intervention thus increased preference sustainable grocery intervention group explained efficacy in sum result research project consumer purchase sustainable grocery regular basis tend attach importance welfare long term future consequence action personally
