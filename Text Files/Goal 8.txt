small enterprise productive large The characteristic small enterprises1 constitute overwhelming proportion private sector establishment employ 45 65 cent workforce They important source employment developing developed country Thirdly wage lower worker right condition adequate job quality lower enterprise Taken characteristic significant portion labour force country employed small low productivity establishment worker earn lower wage fewer right worker larger enterprise This depiction small enterprise throw important issue organize around question concern challenge The question inefficient enterprise forced market large productive firm This happen natural process economic competition The survival firm raise important concern poor wage working condition linked lower productivity adequate support decent living In poor country also developed country people working unable poverty This concern raise important challenge interested reducing poverty decent work The challenge way link productivity improvement decent work virtuous cycle In cycle enhanced productivity lead wage benefit working condition working condition achieved effective labour management cooperation social institution broader process social dialogue support higher productivity The present paper organized around issue The question dealt section The probable answer small large firm continue exist compete directly Very small firm notably informal economy tend forced market competition offer employment economy develops The concern analysed section review evidence wage working condition reveals job quality lower small enterprise In case people earning minimum wage We diversity experience enterprise owner poor earn formal sector employee The challenge considered section Here suggest productivity improvement wage working condition encouraged supported training effective social institution The main focus SEED job quality activity example case study The bias labour productivity comparing small large enterprise Much research productivity based single indicator labour productivity This measure easy calculate practical sense comparison time country It measure 1 Unless term small paper group enterprise classified micro small medium The actual size enterprise varies country definition 1 deficiency pose grave concern general cross country comparison pose problem comparing large small enterprise Productivity relationship output input It rise increase output occurs proportionate increase input output produced fewer input In case ratio output quantity quality input increased When data input total factor productivity TFP calculated Due inclusiveness complete measure It difficult record input sector economy Instead main input calculate multi factor productivity The KLEMS measure includes capital K labour energy material service broader multi factor measure Schreyer Pilat 2001 Labour productivity indicator single factor measure It result calculation added output intermediate component input divided amount labour 2 It also called added worker Despite labour productivity increase added rise utilization coordination factor production Value added increase labour working smarter harder faster skill also increase use machinery reduction waste input material introduction technical innovation Indeed raise added raise labour productivity The term correct change increase added make worker productive slightly misleading denotes productivity general specifically relating worker Why understanding labour productivity important relate issue poverty A productivity increase greater return factor production If increase labour productivity arises trained treated efficient worker support higher wage But increase labour productivity arises use additional machinery gain pay machinery This mean enterprise high capital investment obliged higher labour productivity pay additional capital Statistics compare labour productivity large firm small firm exhibit lower capital investment systematic bias There another bias empirical research Much work focus data gathered industrial census survey manufacturing firm Manufacturing much affected economy scale service activity A large proportion small enterprise engaged service notably trading also catering repair work personal service The extent two bias affect data requires research Despite limitation labour productivity measure paper much evidence reviewed based 1 Why small enterprise driven market This section review evidence productivity gap small large enterprise It considers existence gap static sense snapshot contrast important role small enterprise play providing employment The issue employment shift small large enterprise time also 2 Or correctly number hour worked 2 considered The question title answered suggestion small enterprise survive avoiding direct competition large firm 1 1 Cross regional evidence size productivity gap A positive correlation enterprise size labour productivity evident main region developing world That large firm productive Table 1 productivity formal SMEs3 Latin American country range quarter quarter
