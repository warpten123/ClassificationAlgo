risk human right million people right life health food water The risk highest developing country extreme weather event crop failure emergency related climate change projected occur greater frequency Most developing country also lack technological financial resource adapt climate change Indeed facing increased difficulty realizing economic social cultural right people financial economic food crisis growing population The capacity developing country realize human right domestically limited result use developed country global atmospheric space global carbon budget This paper set relevance international human right obligation light multiple constraint climate change pose sustainable development developing country These legally binding obligation agreed state creation United Nations incorporated widely ratified human right treaty Legal human right obligation specifically require state act protect people individual violation human right state cooperate end Climate change impact wide range human right potentially lead widespread violation Preventing climate change induced human right violation requires intensive international cooperation In requires inequity developed developing country people addressed accordance legal principle affirmative action This principle incorporated international human right law expression exception general principle state sovereign equal mean generally state legal obligation It state treat right holder differently treating right holder similarly unequal position inequality maintained This paper demonstrates framework provided United Nations Framework Convention Climate Change UNFCCC suitable facilitate right based cooperation accordance principle affirmative action legal duty state cooperate realize human right The UNFCCC framework including UNFCCC Kyoto Protocol premised legal principle run parallel reinforce international human right obligation The framework balance concern development developing country responsibility obligation country address climate change mitigate human right harm Of importance principle equity differentiated responsibility respective capability developed developing country In accordance principle developed country specific obligation mitigate emission order modify longer term trend global emission provide financing technology transfer developing country adaptation sustainable development An assessment developed country compliance UNFCCC obligation reveals persistent compliance gap It proven difficult address gap legal mechanism notably UNFCCC lack enforcement mechanism In viii inherent legal basis internationally agreed human right norm deserves special attention As legally binding international norm human right rule reaffirmed continuously two third international community two state also Parties UNFCCC Human right also lay basis concept erga omnes obligation owed entire world inhabitant As failure developed country comply UNFCCC obligation result widespread human right violation developing country turn international tribunal address failure In word international tribunal requested clarify legal obligation state international human right law relation climate change climate change legislation This opportunity encouraging timely adequate action climate change viable compliance minimum norm continues economic ecological inequity developed developing country increase even result I INTRODUCTION It well accepted climate change caused human being The Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change IPCC confirmed report climate change man caused

Article 1 state change climate attributed directly indirectly human activity alters composition global atmosphere addition natural climate variability observed comparable time period 3 International law recognizes evidence climate change caused human being generally human being country greatest contributor climate change Historically developed country result industrialization process production consumption pattern accounted around fourth total anthropogenic emission greenhouse gas atmosphere start Industrial Revolution around 1850 present Developing country larger population result lower industrialization level contributed much anthropogenic emission Currently 15 cent world population developed country account 45 cent CO2 emission 4 By 2030 developing country projected account half
