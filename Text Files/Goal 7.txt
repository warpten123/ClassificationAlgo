greenhouse gas GHGs carbon dioxide global concern reducing carbon emission In regard different policy applied reduce carbon emission enhancing renewable energy deployment encouraging technological innovation In addition supporting mechanism feed tariff renewable portfolio standard tax policy employed government develop renewable energy generation implementing energy use efficiency saving energy Many country started install facility use renewable energy source power generation The importance alternative energy source climate change challenge excessive use fossil fuel There primary motivator stimulate growth renewable energy technology energy security economic impact carbon dioxide emission reduction The term alternative energy refers form energy conventional source energy including hydropower In recent year focus renewable energy source IEA 2012d refers two significant global trend characterize deployment renewable technology medium term First renewable electricity technology scale total global supply 1 454 gigawatts GW 2011 2 167 GW 2017 also spread geographically Second recent year high fossil fuel energy use led renewable technology increasingly competitive cost basis alternative number country circumstance According IEA calculation wind competitive type renewable energy technology option local condition financing CO emission level fossil fuel price 2 prove favorable OECD 2010 When talking clean technology two primary concept energy technology energy supply technology refers alternative source renewable energy wind solar power energy efficiency technology technology hired enhance energy use efficiency combined heat power CHP virtual power plant VPP smart meter It noted transforming energy sector replacing conventional energy renewable energy evolutionary technological change forming market Jacobsson Bergek 2004 transforming process form renewable energy wind solar happen 2020 even growth rate consumption strongly increasing decade Also renewable energy market easily formed cost disadvantage subsidizing fossil fuel The remainder study proceeds In Section 2 present different renewable energy supply technology including solar wind hydro power geothermal source In Section 3 different energy use efficiency technology discussed These include electric vehicle combined heat power virtual power plant application smart meter The final section summary concludes 2 Renewable Energy Supply Technologies The renewable energy supply continuously increasing A large amount investment recent year advancement technology enabled country produce renewable energy cost effectively It forecasted number country producing 100 megawatt MW renewable energy increase significantly 3 2017 IEA 2012d Due negative irreversible externality coming conventional energy production promote develop renewable energy supply technology These technology comparable conventional fuel term production cost comparable externality environmental social effect Also noted economy scale play key role reducing unit production cost Transmission distribution cost well technology differ much conventional renewable energy Below present fact development main renewable energy supply technology 2 1 Hydro power Hydro power largest renewable energy source power generation around world Hydro electricity generation strong increase past 50 year It 340 terawatt
