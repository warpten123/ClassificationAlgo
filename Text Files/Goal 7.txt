major component greenhouse gases GHGs carbon dioxide global concern reducing carbon emissions In regard different policies applied reduce carbon emissions enhancing renewable energy deployment encouraging technological innovations In addition supporting mechanisms feed tariffs renewable portfolio standards tax policies employed governments develop renewable energy generation implementing energy use efficiency saving energy Many countries started install facilities use renewable energy sources power generation The importance alternative energy sources climate change challenges excessive use fossil fuels There primary motivators stimulate growth renewable energy technologies energy security economic impacts carbon dioxide emission reduction The term alternative energy refers form energy conventional sources energy including hydropower In recent years focus renewable energy sources IEA 2012d refers two significant global trends characterize deployment renewable technologies medium term First renewable electricity technologies scale total global supply 1 454 gigawatts GW 2011 2 167 GW 2017 also spread geographically Second recent years high fossil fuel energy use led renewable technologies increasingly competitive cost basis alternatives number countries circumstances According IEA calculations wind competitive type renewable energy technology options local conditions financing CO emission levels fossil fuel prices 2 prove favorable OECD 2010 When talking clean technologies two primary concepts energy technologies energy supply technologies refers alternative sources renewable energy wind solar power energy efficiency technologies technologies hired enhance energy use efficiency combined heat power CHP virtual power plants VPP smart meters It noted transforming energy sector replacing conventional energy renewable energy evolutionary technological change forming markets Jacobsson Bergek 2004 transforming process forms renewable energy wind
