4 Abstract Consumers contribute sustainable development choose environmentally friendly fair trade product sustainable product everyday grocery shopping On downside purchasing sustainable grocery requires extra effort sustainable product expensive conventional product What beneficial effect sustainable consumption environmental preservation materialize time result repeated purchase people Because collective effort needed achieve sustainability individual consumer uncertain purchase decision make difference This research project addressed question motivate consumer purchase sustainable grocery uncertainty individual drawback sustainable consumption There two main objective investigate individual characteristic distinguish frequent buyer sustainable grocery frequent buyer provide insight consumer encouraged purchase sustainable grocery To end two study conducted Study 1 online survey addressed objective More precisely purpose study investigate well social value time perspective efficacy predict purchasing sustainable grocery In domain grocery purchasing individual characteristic studied As efficacy general sustainable development efficacy explored The former refers people perceived general ability deal stressor achieve desired outcome latter refers degree people feel contribute sustainable development construct studied It assumed pro social value long term time perspective high efficacy characterize consumer frequently purchase sustainable grocery Consumers purchase sustainable grocery frequently contrast assumed attach importance pro value short 5 term time perspective low efficacy Taking study 402 people living municipality Bergen Norway The finding study reported two paper Paper 1 introduces construct sustainable development efficacy explores dimensionality It also report relation sustainable development efficacy general efficacy purchasing sustainable grocery It different facet sustainable development efficacy distinguished Most importantly perceived ability directly contribute sustainable development action represented facet different represent perceived ability indirectly contribute sustainable development encouraging people engage sustainable behavior In sum perceived ability indirectly contribute sustainable development predicted sustainable consumption perceived ability directly contribute sustainable development General efficacy weakly related sustainable development efficacy unrelated purchasing sustainable grocery Paper 2 report relation social value time perspective sustainable development efficacy purchasing sustainable grocery With regard efficacy people perceived ability indirectly contribute sustainable development investigated It social value time perspective efficacy accounted overlapping part variance sustainable consumption The relation focal variable generally expected direction Study 2 intervention study addressed objective It investigated consumer encouraged purchase sustainable grocery help informational intervention The main focus intervention provide information individual consumer contribute sustainable development individual contribution sustainable development encourage consumer join The effect intervention sustainable 6 development efficacy sustainable consumption purchasing intention actual product purchase assessed The participant 145 people living municipality Bergen randomly assigned two group intervention group control group The result study reported Paper 3 It intervention strengthened intention purchase domestic seasonal product certified ecological product In addition intervention promoted actual purchasing ecological fair trade product Self efficacy affected intervention Thus increased preference sustainable grocery intervention group explained efficacy In sum result research project consumer purchase sustainable grocery regular basis tend attach importance welfare long term future consequence action personally contribute sustainable development Furthermore consumer encouraged purchase sustainable grocery provided information individual directly indirectly contribute sustainable development These finding
