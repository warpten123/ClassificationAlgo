industrialization strategy implemented 1950s present time including import substitution export orientation heavy industry based strategy Of failed succeed two resulted miracle economic growth much vulnerable exposure foreign capital technology market consideration internal factor This led great economic social environmental imbalance One undeniable consequence bias current financial crisis As result Asian developing economy turned development trend development strategy sustainable industrialization characterized balanced flexible economic social development greater international regional integration ecological environment 4 INTRODUCTION This paper result Research Project entitled Industrialization Modernization Enhancing Comparative Advantages Experiences Asian Developing Economies development idea suggested occasion author beginning 1990s The leading idea research perception comparative advantage high efficiency industrialization modernization developing economy The analysis major source comparative advantage labor natural resource capital technology market exploited Asian developing economy industrialization review industrialization strategy adopted Asian developing economy import substitution export orientation heavy industry based industrialization suggests I IMPORT SUBSTITUTION AND EXPORT ORIENTATION RAPID BUT BIASED HEAVY INDUSTRY BASED TOO HEAVY TO MOVE 1 Market It chance narrow view point reliance played role background import substitution strategy bankrupt needed reorientation redefinition case India number developing economy Even country China considered great socialist nation vast labor reservoir rich natural resource huge domestic market mean hand building country developing economy regarded principle independence reliance fundamental economic construction finally admit owing prolonged seclusion world opportunity missed The technological gap China foreign country widened absence competition international market domestic product competitive Some industrial product qualitatively quantitatively improved owing limitation domestic market 1 5 A state billion people finally admit limitation domestic market This run directly counter view China India developing economy 1950s emphasized importance domestic factor The situation posed economist developing economy question examining series problem possibility limitation state process economic development international division labor In sixteenth seventeenth century international trade developed vigorously two main factor growth capitalist economy discovery land In eighteenth nineteenth century classical economist demonstrated highly efficient division labor realized individual single country also country nation It unfortunate 1950s economist policy maker developing economy fear exploitation imperialism motivated high sense independence strong build economy lesson history underestimated opportunity brought international division labor In economy size population principal criterion determining capacity market According approach populated country larger market But developing modern industry large scale production limitation domestic market gradually uncovered Step step realized determining factor capacity market purchasing power solely population size even latter play important role In India instance decade development realized population around 900 million people average annual caput income 400 US dollar 10 cent buy durable family consumer good radio television set air conditioner refrigerator Most rest population afford buy basic good minimum necessity food clothing People living poverty line account half population India money buy even item basic In condition say world market relied developing economy develop domestic industry 2 Capital 4 Inclusive Sustainable Industrial Development Inclusive sustainable industrial development ISID Creating shared prosperity Economic growth driven entrepreneurship continuous economic diversification

Republic created developing country doubled Korea China Asian tiger past 20 year 18 percent 1992 35 dragon industrial development percent 2012 The structural transformation trade industrial good shaped occurs economy high reliance success agriculture natural resource extraction activity foster local addition related service dramatic development impact It unleashes dynamic competitive economic force generate employment income facilitate international trade use resource efficiently This experience repeated around world original industrial revolution mid 18th century Creating shared prosperity 5 However improve living standard Based experience essential woman men benefit growth integrate woman youth process creating shared equitably industrial workforce This yield positive multiplier effect household community This achieved decent employment also contributes greater social cohesion opportunity segment labour force Manufacturing industry Increased participation international trade also related service sector absorb large number help improve local working condition worker provide stable job comply international standard good benefit increase prosperity greater access modern technology family community An efficient agro industry practice combined increased investment agriculture enhances economic stability rural household Industry important source decent increase food security promotes innovation employment accounting 500 million throughout industrial chain job worldwide world workforce Only economy Experiences past decade shared ability constantly generate activity based prosperity case based progress upgrading higher level addition higher absorbing labour force effectively productivity higher return scale economy higher income industrial job characterized structural change sustain stable job increase prosperity growing share population 6 Inclusive Sustainable Industrial Development Inclusive sustainable industrial development ISID Safeguarding environment Any progress poverty eradication short lived succeed achieving economic growth environmentally sustainable framework The importance promoting cleaner resource We technological capability cleaner efficient pathway production coupling industrial production today Green industry economic growth environmental degradation promoted deliver environmental good service emphasized strongly These industry sustainable source structural diversification job income We deny effect industrialization prosperity Moreover committing sustainable considerable environmental footprint There production pattern make business sense reduces country fully resolved issue wastage costly resource contributes waste management water purification pollution increased competitiveness However experience show environmentally sound intervention manufacturing industry There also imperative increase energy efficiency highly effective significantly reduce environmental industrial production Since energy input represent degradation important cost production industry clean energy energy efficiency progressively In context drive innovation process core determinant economic competitiveness optimization core industrial upgrading sustained growth effort important mean develop solution realize cleaner production efficient Demanding choose industrial growth resource management reduction waste sustainability wrong approach It pollution transformation production process business model hand hand right choice technology present solution daunting environmental
