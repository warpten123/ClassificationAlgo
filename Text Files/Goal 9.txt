advantages Asian developing economies labor natural resources capital technologies markets aim reassess industrialization strategies implemented 1950s present time including import substitution export orientation heavy industries based strategies Of failed succeed two resulted miracle economic growth much vulnerable exposure foreign capital technologies markets consideration internal factors This led great economic social environmental imbalances One undeniable consequences biases current financial crisis As result Asian developing economies turned development trend development strategy sustainable industrialization characterized balanced flexible economic social development greater international regional integration ecological environment 4 INTRODUCTION This paper result Research Project entitled Industrialization Modernization Enhancing Comparative Advantages Experiences Asian Developing Economies development ideas suggested occasions author beginning 1990s The leading idea research perception comparative advantage high efficiency industrialization modernization developing economy The analysis major sources comparative advantage labor natural resources capital technologies market exploited Asian developing economies industrialization review industrialization strategies adopted Asian developing economies import substitution export orientation heavy industry based industrialization suggests I IMPORT SUBSTITUTION AND EXPORT ORIENTATION RAPID BUT BIASED HEAVY INDUSTRY BASED TOO HEAVY TO MOVE 1 Market It chance narrow view point reliance played role background import substitution strategy bankrupt needed reorientation redefinition case India number developing economies Even country China considered great socialist nation vast labor reservoir rich natural resources huge domestic market means hand building country developing economy regarded principle independence reliance fundamental economic construction finally admit owing prolonged seclusion world opportunities missed The technological gap China foreign countries widened absence competition international market domestic products competitive Some industrial products qualitatively quantitatively improved owing limitations domestic market 1 5 A state billion people finally admit limitation domestic market This runs directly counter view China India developing economies 1950s emphasized importance domestic factors The situation posed economists developing economies question examining series problems possibilities limitations states process economic development international division labor In sixteenth seventeenth centuries international trade developed vigorously two main factors growth capitalist economy discovery lands In eighteenth nineteenth centuries classical economists demonstrated highly efficient division labor realized individuals single country also countries nations It unfortunate 1950s economists policy makers developing economies fear exploitation imperialism motivated high sense independence strong build economy lessons history underestimated opportunities brought international division labor In economies size population principal criterion determining capacity market According approach populated country larger market But developing modern industry large scale production limitations domestic markets gradually uncovered Step step realized determining factor capacity market purchasing power solely population size even latter play important role In India instance decades development realized population around 900 million people average annual capita income 400 US dollars 10 cent buy durable family consumer goods radios television sets air conditioners refrigerators Most rest population afford buy basic goods minimum necessities food clothing People living poverty line account half population India money buy even items basic In conditions say world market relied developing economies develop domestic industry 2

diversification growing trade relations industrial upgrading technological innovation Evidence proving industrialization To developing countries successful effective poverty reduction strategy hard examples role models effectively Whether early advances lifting large numbers people poverty European countries United States Japan caught global trend Already share manufacturing added latter half 20th century including Republic created developing countries doubled Korea China Asian tigers past 20 years 18 percent 1992 35 dragons industrial development percent 2012 The structural transformation trade industrial goods shaped occurs economies high reliance successes agriculture natural resource extraction activities foster local addition related services dramatic development impact It unleashes dynamic competitive economic forces generate employment income facilitate international trade use resources efficiently This experience repeated around world original industrial revolution mid 18th century Creating shared prosperity 5 However improve living standards Based experience essential women men benefits growth integrate women youth process creating shared equitably industrial workforce This yields positive multiplier effects households communities This achieved decent employment also contributes greater social cohesion opportunities segments labour force Manufacturing industries Increased participation international trade also related services sectors absorb large numbers helps improve local working conditions workers provide stable jobs comply international standards good benefits increase prosperity greater access modern technologies families communities An efficient agro industry practices combined increased investment agriculture enhances economic stability rural households Industry important source decent increases food security promotes innovation employment accounting 500 million throughout industrial chains jobs worldwide world workforce Only economies Experiences past decade shared ability constantly generate activities based prosperity cases based progress upgrading higher levels addition higher absorbing labour force effectively productivity higher returns scale economies higher income industrial jobs characterized structural change sustain stable jobs increase prosperity growing share population 6 Inclusive Sustainable Industrial Development Inclusive sustainable industrial development ISID Safeguarding environment Any progress poverty eradication short lived succeed achieving economic growth environmentally sustainable framework The importance promoting cleaner resource We technological capabilities cleaner efficient pathways production coupling industrial production today Green industry economic growth environmental degradation promoted deliver environmental goods services emphasized strongly These industries sustainable source structural diversification jobs income We deny effect industrialization prosperity Moreover committing sustainable considerable environmental footprint There production patterns makes business sense reduces country fully resolved issues wastage costly resources contributes waste management water purification pollution increased competitiveness However experience shows environmentally sound interventions manufacturing industries There also imperative increase energy efficiency highly effective significantly reduce environmental industrial production Since energy inputs represent degradation important cost production industries clean energy energy efficiency progressively In context drive innovation process core determinants economic competitiveness optimization core industrial upgrading sustained growth effort important means develop solutions realize cleaner production efficient Demanding choose industrial growth resource management reductions waste sustainability wrong approach It pollution transformation production processes business models hand hand right choice technologies present solutions daunting environmental challenges times
