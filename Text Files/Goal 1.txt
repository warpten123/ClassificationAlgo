Russell 1999 Shachar Neumann 2003 Machtmes Asher 2002 significant difference grade online student traditional classroom based 55 student These analysis utilized multiple study information comparing grade online student traditional face face student primarily utilizing test preferred methodology The result previous research supported present study Additionally study analyzing data semester controlling effect different instructor These result contrary conclusion reached Phipps Merisotis 1999 The purpose study determine significant difference existed retention student enrolled online TA course student enrolled face face course Meta analysis conducted Phipps Merisotis 1999 Nora Snyder 2009 concluded much lower retention rate online student compared face face counterpart The previous meta analysis examined retention online student traditional face face student distinct course utilizing test primary methodology The chosen method test chi square testing limitation study taught instructor limited semester cycle Carr 2002 reported The Chronicle Higher Education retention online student 50 traditional face face student Carr result based examination longitudinal retention data university reported United States Department Education The result present study significant difference retention rate These result supported finding Carmel Gold 2007 reported significant difference retention rate online student compared traditional face face student analysis student multiple 56 course discipline 4 year university The present study expanded result examining data discipline 6 year period controlling delivery two separate instructor Research program completion rate AAS student conducted primarily traditional university setting including Townsend 2002 study University Missouri Columbia Townsend result showed lower baccalaureate completion rate student entering AAS student transferred 4 year university AA degree Studies Hogan 1997 vocational education program also lower program completion rate online student compared student traditional delivery vocational education program Analysis data current study showed significant difference program completion rate student began online TA course compared student began program face face course Conclusions The use distance education postsecondary instruction primarily form Internet changed challenged view traditional university based instruction Multiple study designed effort examine online student level academic achievement traditional higher education peer The present study agrees research indicating statistically significant difference grade online student face face counterpart In addition student retention issue postsecondary institution data previous study lower retention rate online student traditional face face classmate The current study contradicted 57 argument In section implication action recommendation research concluding remark addressed Implications Action As postsecondary institution 21st century examined issue student recruitment retention effort meet demand student community The majority postsecondary institution initiated online education strategy recruit student traditional geographic area This study supported existing research utilizing grade measure achievement alleviate doubt online student shortchanged education The transition existing face face course online delivery model accomplished sacrificing achievement program goal The study also examined program retention data finding significant difference online traditional student TA program The finding study support expansion additional online course program School Applied Studies Finally study provide basis action including analyzing program course offered online format University The analysis program offered online delivery model enhance development online course program Recommendations Future Research Distance education delivery expanded dramatically use Internet online instruction The present study continued future year measure effect specific curriculum delivery model online 58 delivery platform In addition study expanded include specific characteristic student retention named literature examining age entering GPA student insight program retention The study also expanded include university similar baccalaureate degree completion program discipline Because body research limited baccalaureate degree completion student begin postsecondary education career oriented instruction continuing study baccalaureate completion rate online format traditionally based setting Concluding Remarks The current study examined Technology Administration program offered online face face format utilizing data Fall 2002 Spring 2008 The TA program developed student completed occupationally oriented AAS degree complete bachelor degree program Three hypothesis tested study examining grade retention program retention student enrolled online face face course Technology Administration No significant difference hypothesis These result form strong foundation expanding online course program Washburn University By addressing two major concern educator achievement retention study result expansion online course program benefit data driven decision making Other institution utilize data examine existing online program data 59 REFERENCES Allen I E Seaman J 2003
