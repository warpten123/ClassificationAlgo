EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY In Sana Basin capital Yemen situated development deeper aquifer greatly increased meet dual demand domestic water supply irrigation As result water shortage worse accelerated continued imbalance annual recharge growing water demand Sana Basin designated Water Protection Zone Cabinet Decree No 344 2002 designated critical basin Then National Water Resources Authority Sana Branch NWRA SB established 2003 implement activity related water resource management Sana Basin Additionally Sana Basin Commission SBC organized technical secretariat NWRA SB execute management water resource Sana Basin Comprehensive water resource study inside Sana Basin conducted 1970s NWRA SB faced difficulty implementing water resource management effectively In context Government Yemen requested Government Japan execute technical cooperation plan formulate water resource management action plan Sana Basin based existing data information 2 FUTURE SCENARIOS BASED ON
