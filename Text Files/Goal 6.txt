EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY In Sana Basin capital Yemen situated development deeper aquifer greatly increased meet dual demands domestic water supply irrigation As result water shortage worse accelerated continued imbalance annual recharge growing water demand Sana Basin designated Water Protection Zone Cabinet Decree No 344 2002 designated critical basins Then National Water Resources Authority Sana Branch NWRA SB established 2003 implement activities related water resources management Sana Basin Additionally Sana Basin Commission SBC organized technical secretariat NWRA SB execute management water resources Sana Basin Comprehensive water resources studies inside Sana Basin conducted 1970s NWRA SB faced difficulties implementing water resources management effectively In context Government Yemen requested Government Japan execute technical cooperation plan formulate water resources management action plan Sana Basin based existing data information 2 FUTURE SCENARIOS BASED ON SOCIO ECONOMY AND WATER DEMAND IN SANA A BASIN 1 Future Water Balance The projected future water demand gradually increased 269 3 MCM 2005 349 6 MCM 2020 As time renewable groundwater resources estimated 50 7 MCM year The balance renewable resources demand estimated minus 298 9 MCM 2020 recharge amount changed The implication numbers renewable water resources continue
